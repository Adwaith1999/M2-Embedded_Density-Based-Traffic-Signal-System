- **INTRODUCTION:**

- Nowadays, controlling the traffic becomes major issue because of rapid increase in automobiles and also because of large time delays between traffic lights. So, in order to rectify this problem, we will go for density based traffic lights system. 
- The aim of the project is to solve traffic congestion which is a severe problem in many modern cities all over the world.
- To solve the problem, a framework for a dynamic and automatic traffic light control system has been designed and developed a simulation model with codes in to help build the system
- Generally, each traffic light on an intersection is assigned a constant green signal time.
- It is possible to propose dynamic time based coordination schemes where the green signal time of the traffic lights is assigned based on the current conditions of the traffic.


- **SWOT ANALYSIS:**

**Strength:** 
- Avoids wastage of time due to the traffic.
- Fully automatic.
- Low power consumption.
- Low maintainance cost.
- No need of traffic inspector at the junction for supervising the traffic to run smoothly.V

**Weakness:**
- They are much more scalable with the progress in image progressing techniques.
- The sensors which are used to quantify the traffic flow are very expensive.

**Opportunities:**
- A system where WIFI technology should be used as it has a wider range and more functionalities than bluetooth technology.
- The system should be powered by a solar system to promote green energy operations and reduce consumption of electricity from the grid.
- A surveillance system should be installed to capture the vehicles going beyond the stated speed limit.

**Threats:**
- It needs a lot of maintainance especially in developing countries because of the road ground de-formations. 
- Video Based Systems are much better compared to all other techniques as they provide more traffic information. 


- **4W & 1H:**

**What:**  The project density-based traffic light control is an automated way of controlling signals in accordance to the density of traffic in the roads.

**Where:** This model can be used effectively used at the junctions or 4-way roads where the possibility of congestion is high & also at accident prone zones.

**Why:** Traffic control has as its principal objective to manage the movement of people and goods as efficiently and safely as possible.

**When:** This project comes into effect when traffic inspectors are unable to control the congestion of traffic and also to prevent the cases of overspeeding.

**How:** The project density-based traffic light control automates the timing of the traffic signal according to the density of the traffic on respective roads.


- **HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:**

- Currently, traffic lights are set in different lanes with fixed time delays, following a specific cycle while changing from one signal to another making undesirable and unwanted congestion on one lane with alternate lanes stay empty.
- This system will use IR sensors to measure the traffic density. We have to arrange one IR sensor for each road; these sensors always sense the traffic on that particular road. All these sensors are interfaced to the microcontroller. Based on these sensors, controller detects the traffic and controls the traffic system.
- The design would reduce the frequent occurrence of accidents resulting from lack of patience by road users.


- **LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:**

- Over-speeding is one of the main reasons of accidents on our roads will also be curbed.
- Due to Traffic congestion most of the productive time is lost by being stuck in traffic jams, so this issue can be solved with the help of this model.
- the system would help onroad police in tracking and detecting traffic defaulters.
- Fuel consumption will be greatly reduced.
